Displays a tag at the top of the website that shows the current width of the browser window and the device that this width is associated with, to help with responsive design in the development stage.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

= Usage =

Turn the tag on inside the Responsive page and it will display at the top of the site. The width in pixels will update dynamically as you resize the browser window.
